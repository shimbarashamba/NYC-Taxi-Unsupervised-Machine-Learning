# NYC-Taxi-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
 Using unsupervised machine learning to find patterns in a dataset of NYC taxi trips 2015. The dataset can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data
 Two clusters were found using K-means clustering: longer and shorter trips. The dataset containes coordinates for pickup point and dropoff point, which allowed me to use the python library Folium to put the trips on a map. It was discovered that the long trips usually go to and from airports, while the short ones begin and end on Manhattan. 
 
 On average, it seems like most long trips take place at around 3 pm, while the short ones take place around 6 pm, possibly because of people leaving work. A vast majority of trips are short ones. In a business setting, I would recommend always having taxis ready outside of popular work areas between 17 pm and 22 pm, and long distance taxis always ready in the afternoon.
